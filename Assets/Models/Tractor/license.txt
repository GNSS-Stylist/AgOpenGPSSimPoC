This work is based on "tractor" (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/tractor-2614ec07916d4b2da2d096f78420c905) by ahmadbaroud (https://sketchfab.com/ahmadbaroud60) licensed under CC-BY-4.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

These modification were made to the original model mentioned above:
- The original model was "disassembled" to separate objects.
- Tires and rims were separated from the original model and re-constructed in Godot Engine to make them usable in the simulated tractor. Their location have been changed a bit.
- Front axle was replaced with one modeled in Godot Engine.
- Some parts of the cabin were separated from the rest of the body to make them hideable (mostly to make view from the cabin less obstructed).
- Steering wheel was replaced with another model (this change doesn't actually affect this model, but the replacement steering wheel is shown in the place of the original one).
